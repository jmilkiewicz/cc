Feature: Add asset for a brand

  As a user
  I want to add a new file
  So that it will be stored in system for future use

  Background:
    Given "John" is an authenticated user

  Scenario: Success
    When "John" adds an asset:
      | FileName    |  DocumentDate   | File           |
      | Croatia2014 |   2011-01-01    |  sunset.jpg    |
    Then the following documents will exist in the System
      |Id | FileName    |  DocumentDate   | UploadDate   |  File         | UploadPerson |
      |0  | Croatia2014 |   01/01/11      | 01/01/14      |sunset.jpg    | John         |
    And "John" will go to files uploaded by "John"
    #TODO a mo≈ºe will receive a feedback that his operation was succesfull
    And "John" will see a message indicating success
